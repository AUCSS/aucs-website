# The Database

Behind the website we will need a database 

Mikko: 
        I suggest MongoDB as opposed to a regular SQL database. It offers a different (and in my opinion, a lot clearer) object-oriented approach to queries. It also seems to be somewhat faster than SQL. JSON integration would be easy. Take a look at it, see what you think.
