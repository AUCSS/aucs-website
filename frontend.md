# Frontend

* Using the current standards, which are CSS3 and HTML5 for frontend
* Do we want SCSS to easily develop/modify the CSS sheets?

# JavaScript

* Do we want to ditch JavaScript altogether? In my opinion, there is no reason to have JavaScript required on some portions of the website (e.g. registration, CAPTCHA in JavaScript...) and not use it on others.
* This doesn't have to mean the site won't work without JavaScript, but that the primary design would be using it, and then we could polyfill for the users without JavaScript.
* Or we could ditch JavaScript altogether, and try to design the site without it
