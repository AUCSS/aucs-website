# Web Sever.

The only thing running on the Hopper is the WebServer, which is a VM running on Turing, 
The Domain is controlled by Iain Learmonth,

One task is to wipe the server and reinstall the base operating system, we need access to the location of the server in buchart.

From here we will add a VM for the website in the same way add Lets-Encrypt to the server to enable secure HTTPS access.
